# NATURE-FRIENDLY-WEBSITE
THIS WEBSITE IS CREATED FOR DEVPOST HACKATHON!!
## Inspiration
Environmental pollution is one of the most crucial global issues today. 
Various pollutants in our environment (air, water, and soil) including pesticides, 
herbicides, and heavy metals exhibit hazardous effects on the human body, animals, 
and plants.
Promoting environmental awareness is an easy way to become an environmental steward 
and participate in creating a brighter future for the upcoming generations. Environmental awareness is to understand the fragility of our environment and the 
importance of its protection. 
This awareness among us has inspired us to develop a web project which can help reduce 
the pollution in our surroundings. 
## What it does
Our project has four modules. First module detects the amount of the air pollution in any city. 
Second module detects the amount of water used by us in a single day for various purposes. This helps us to overcome the wastage of water and limit the usage as far as possible.
Third module includes quiz on environmental pollution which provides awareness among us.
Fourth module includes the simple timer which tracks our daily walking time instead using motorcycles which are environmental hazards.In future we can also add the time conversions which can convert your time traveled on bike to walking so that you can start to destination ahead which are nearby.
## How we built it
We have used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Geo location for developing our project.
## Challenges we ran into
While working on this project we have come across few challenges on how to reduce various
types of pollution which dont show any impact on human health and how to educate people
around us on the dangers of pollution.
Creating public awareness about pollution helps people to develop a desire to protect 
their natural resources for future generations.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It feels great to come up with unique idea and able to code few of its modules in time
## What we learned
While working on this project we came up with many new ideas in tech to walk towards healthy Environment which seemed scopeless before.Also created ah simple yet useful website which have future scope of extension into app

## What's next for Nature Friendly Website
We wanted to add more modules covering all environmental issues and improving awareness among users in friendly way(through quizes , puzles, games etc...).We also want to add the Improvised tracker which tracks users water,motorcycle usage and various activities and gives user rating.User with highest rating can top the leaderboard which gives healthy competition among website users to stay nature friendly.
